= Slides for Full Stack Java with JSweet, Angular 2, PrimeNG, and JAX-RS

This is part of the sample application for the presentation "Full Stack Java with JSweet, Angular 2, PrimeNG, and JAX-RS",
originally given at JavaOne in September, 2016 by https://www.linkedin.com/in/kitomann[Kito D. Mann] from
https://virtua.tech[Virtua, Inc.]. It demonstrates how you can write an https://angular.io[Angular 2] application with
http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/[PrimeNG] components using Java (courtesy of the
 http://jsweet.org[JSweet] transpiler), and have it talk to a standard Java back-end using https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/[JAX-RS].

== Viewing

These slides are in pure HTML -- just view angular-primeng-jsweet-jaxrs.html and you're good to go!

You can also https://kito99.github.io/angular-primeng-jsweet-todo-slides/[view them online].

== Building

=== Setting up the project

The presentation slides are plain HTML and http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/[reveal.js^], built using
http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor^].

To generate all of the HTML slides from the source, first, change to the project folder.

Next, install Node and npm. Then, install grunt:

----
npm install
----

In order to run Asciidoctor, you'll need Ruby and Bundlr installed. First, install Ruby (this comes pre-installed on
some Linux systems and Mac OS X). Next, install Bundlr if you haven't already:

`gem install bundlr`

Then run bundlr to install Asciidoctor and the reaveljs-asciidoctor integration:

`bundle`

Next, intiialize the project by running:

grunt init


=== Building


Finally, run the build:

----
grunt build
----
